# Minesweeper-Game

Made the complete Minesweeper game in a GUI environment. As an improvement from the original game, this has multiple options for setting the colours of squares, as well as several diferent themes available for the numbers displayed.

This repository consists of 3 different versions of the game:

* CLI Minesweeper : A command line version of the game
* Minesweeper : A GUI version of the game
* Minesweeper : A significant improvement over the first GUI version of the game. Very much like the actual minesweeper game that's available on Windows 7 OS computers.

## Game UI (for v2.0)
